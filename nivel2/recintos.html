                <h2>
                    Bogota Campus
                </h2> <br>
                <p>
                    The growth of the digital economy in Colombia has a great demand for talent to which the country
                    cannot respond. According to Fedesoft and MinTIC statistics, it is estimated that in Colombia the
                    deficit of software development professionals is more than
                    50 thousand people. However, the need for talent focuses not only on technical skills (since the
                    future of work is the automation of repetitive tasks), but also focuses on the development of soft
                    skills such as critical thinking, work
                    on team and assertive communication. Bogotá is not the first city that comes to mind when you think
                    about entrepreneurship, technology and innovation, but in Latin America, things are starting to grow
                    rapidly. With strong government
                    support and tax exemptions for foreign investors, Bogotá's position as a hugely influential city in
                    South America is accelerating. Our Bogotá campus is located in the district of zone G, close to
                    important companies and the development
                    of the technological sector. The city is home to the country's first unicorn, Rappi, which is also
                    one of the main donors of the program's operation. With the high cost of education in Colombia and
                    the few job opportunities in traditional
                    careers, Holberton arrives with an innovative and accessible proposal for people who want to learn
                    to program. In addition, the school focuses on providing essential social skills training for any
                    worker.

                <h2 class="titulo"> Medellin Campus</h2> <br>
                <p>
                    Also known as the City of Eternal Spring, Medellín has established itself as a pioneer in technology
                    and innovation. Named the most innovative city in the world in 2013, it has also become the Center
                    of the World Economic Forum for the Fourth Industrial
                    Revolution for Latin America. The new global companies have made Medellin their home, including
                    Ayenda, backed by Softbank, the autonomous delivery company KiwiCampus and the builder of artificial
                    intelligence companies AI Fund. Large
                    global consulting firms such as Huge Inc, Accenture, Endava and Globant are also taking advantage of
                    Medellin's talent. Our campus is located in the gastronomic and cultural center of El Poblado, 5
                    minutes walk from the metro station
                    and within walking distance of restaurants, bars and discos.

                <h2 class="titulo">Cali Campus</h2>
                <p>
                    A city of 3.4 million people, Cali is the third largest city in Colombia and the most important city
                    on the southwest coast of Colombia. An economic powerhouse, Cali is home to some of Colombia's
                    largest and most influential companies such as Carvajal,
                    Open Software, Delima, Datecsa, Eficacia, Colombina, Tecnoquimicas and Lafrancol. Cali also hosts
                    many multinational companies such as Colgate, Baxter, Johnson & Johnson and more. As a cultural
                    destination, it is known as the "Salsa
                    Capital of the World" due to its famous salsa and nightlife festivals. A growing technological city,
                    local and international companies recognize the talent and momentum of the local workforce. In
                    combination with Cali Zonamerica, a
                    special economic Free Zone in Colombia that supports a global services market, Cali is on its way to
                    becoming one of the world's leading technological destinations. Our campus in Cali is located within
                    Cali Zonamerica. As our students
                    learn, they will be surrounded by opportunities to take their software engineering education at the
                    Silicon Valley level directly.
